# C++ modules

This is a collection of C++ projects that I completed as part of the 42 curriculum.  
The projects cover a range of topics, from basic object-oriented programming concepts to more advanced topics such as templates, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Each project is designed to test your understanding of a particular aspect of C++, and you are expected to write code that is well-organized, efficient, and conforms to the 42 coding standards.

### Project Structure

The `cpp_pool` project is divided into several sub-projects, each of which focuses on a specific topic. Here are the sub-projects that are included:

- `day_00`: Basic structure of C++: classes, member functions, etc.
- `day_01`: `new` keyword, pointers to members, references, switch statement
- `day_02`: Ad-hoc polymorphism, overloads and orthodox canonical classes
- `day_03`: Inheritance
- `day_04`: Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces
- `day_05`: Try/Catch exceptions, repetition
- `day_06`: Casting (static, dynamic)
- `day_07`: Templates
- `day_08`: Templated containers, iterators, algorithms
